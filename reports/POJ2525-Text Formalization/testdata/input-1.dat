The ACM can't solve Can't CAN'T solve CaN't solve

all the problems in CS. Though large and having

many resources at its disposal, the ACM doesn't use magic. Magic isn't

suggestions.

Signed, ACM

The ACM doesn't like magic.

It's not that the ACM won't use it, it's

just that the ACM doesn't understand magic.
